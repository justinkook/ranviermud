# Act 1 Main Quest: Find a Cure (covers Emerald Grove and Moonrise path)
- id: find_a_cure
  title: "Find a Cure for the Parasite"
  level: 1
  description: |
    You carry a mind flayer parasite in your brain. It hasn’t turned you yet, but time is short. Find a way to remove or control the tadpole before you become a mind flayer.
    1. **Escape the Nautiloid:** Survive the crash and regroup with other survivors [oai_citation:51‡en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_3#:~:text=The%20protagonist%20wakes%20up%20inside,all%20likewise%20implanted%20with%20tadpoles).
    2. **Seek Help at the Grove:** Investigate the nearby druid grove for a healer. You learned a high druid named Halsin might know of a cure.
    3. **Resolve the Grove’s Crisis:** The grove’s healers won’t assist while under threat. Decide the conflict between the tiefling refugees and the goblin cultists (side with the grove or the Absolute).
    4. **Pursue the Leads:** Halsin (if found) directs you towards Moonrise Towers, suspecting the cult there has answers. Alternatively, goblin leaders mention Moonrise and a “True Soul” ritual. Proceed through either the Mountain Pass or Underdark to reach Moonrise.

    Moonrise Towers lies beyond a land cursed in eternal darkness. With Halsin/Jaheira’s guidance, find refuge and allies in the Shadow-Cursed Lands, and weaken Ketheric Thorm’s immortality.
    1. **Last Light Inn:** Find the safe haven run by the Harpers. Protect Isobel, whose Selûnite powers keep the darkness at bay.

# Act 3 Main Quest: The Final Assault
- id: absolute_bane
  title: "Confront the Absolute"
  level: 7
  description: |
    The cult’s leaders regroup in Baldur’s Gate. Orin and Gortash hold the remaining Netherstones. You must stop their tyrannical plans and assemble the crown to challenge the Elder Brain.
    1. **Investigate Baldur’s Gate:** Navigate the Lower City under Gortash’s martial law. Meet with allies (e.g., Flaming Fist loyalists, Duke Ravengard if found, etc.). Uncover Orin’s murder targets and Gortash’s schemes.
    2. **Disable the Steel Watch:** Discover the Steel Watch Foundry and either destroy it or enlist the Gondian engineers to sabotage Gortash’s constructs, weakening his grip on the city.
    3. **Deal with the Chosen:** Decide whom to confront first – **Lord Gortash** at Wyrm’s Rock or **Orin** in the Temple of Bhaal. (Be wary: if you delay Orin, she might execute her hostage.) Defeat each to obtain their Netherstone [oai_citation:54‡en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_3#:~:text=The%20protagonist%20arrives%20at%20Baldur%27s,triumvirate%20and%20the%20protagonist%27s%20every).
    4. **The Choice of the Emperor:** The Emperor reveals its true identity and the captive Orpheus [oai_citation:55‡en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_3#:~:text=It%20is%20revealed%20that%20the,Emperor%20comes%20to%20the%20rescue). Choose to either trust the Emperor (keeping Orpheus bound) or free Orpheus (possibly turning the Emperor against you) before the final battle.
    5. **Final Battle – The Netherbrain:** With all three Netherstones, storm the Brain’s location beneath the city. Use an Illithid ally to activate the Crown of Karsus and *Karsus’ Compulsion* [oai_citation:56‡bg3.wiki](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Crown_of_Karsus#:~:text=Netherbrain%20%20in%20Act%20Three,defeat%20%2088%20The%20Netherbrain). Battle the Elder Brain and its defenders. Decide to destroy it or control it.

# Side Quest Example: Save the Emerald Grove (Branching Act I outcome)
- id: save_the_grove
  title: "Save the Refugees"
  level: 2
  description: |
    The druid grove harbors tiefling refugees but faces an assault by goblin cultists of the Absolute. You can help **defend the grove** or turn against it.
    - **Defender path:** Recruit allies (Wyll, Halsin) and fortify the grove. Defeat the three goblin leaders (Priestess Gut, Minthara, Dror Ragzlin) to break the siege.
    - **Assault path (evil):** Side with Minthara. Quietly remove tiefling leaders (like Zevlor), then lead the goblins to slaughter the grove. Beware: some companions (Wyll, Karlach) will oppose you.
    Outcome: The grove’s fate is decided. Survivors (if any) will affect your journey (e.g., tieflings possibly aiding in Act 3 if saved).
