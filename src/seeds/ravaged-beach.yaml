    description: |
      The smoking wreck of the Nautiloid lies half-submerged in the sand. Tentacle-like ship appendages are strewn across a beach littered with debris and bodies. Gulls cry overhead and salt spray mixes with the stench of burnt flesh. Among the wreckage, a few survivors stir, dazed from the impact.

    description: |
      A winding path leads from the beach into a sparse coastal forest. Sunlight filters through charred pine trees. The ground shows signs of struggle: footprints, blackened grass, and broken branches. In the distance, faint voices and the crackling of a small campfire can be heard deeper in the woods.
