Timeline of Major Story Events
	1.	Abduction & Nautiloid Crash (1492 DR): The protagonist and others are abducted by mind flayers aboard a hell-bound nautiloid ship and infected with illithid tadpoles ￼. The ship comes under attack by githyanki dragon-riders and devils, then crashes on the Sword Coast, leaving the survivors (all tadpole-infected) stranded near Baldur’s Gate ￼.
	2.	Act I - Emerald Grove Conflict: In the wilderness, the party recruits fellow survivors (e.g. Shadowheart, Astarion, Gale, Lae’zel, Wyll, Karlach) and seeks a cure for the parasite ￼. They reach the Emerald Grove where druids (led by Kagha/Halsin) and tiefling refugees clash with goblin cultists of the “Absolute.” The party either protects the grove from a goblin-led massacre or aids the cult, determining the fate of the refugees ￼. Resolving this yields clues pointing to Moonrise Towers and the cult’s true nature.
	3.	Journey to Moonrise (Act I/II transition): Guided by hints of a cure, the party travels either through the Underdark or overland mountain pass. Along the way, they may encounter the Githyanki Creche (Lae’zel’s people) in search of a purifier for the tadpole, but learn the Astral Prism artifact they carry is highly sought by githyanki. Reaching the shadow-cursed lands surrounding Moonrise, they find refuge at Last Light Inn, protected by a Selûnite blessing.
	4.	Act II - Shadow-Cursed Lands: At Last Light, the party allies with Harpers (led by Jaheira) and survivors against Ketheric Thorm, the tyrant of Moonrise Towers ￼. Ketheric, an undead half-elf and Chosen of Myrkul, has cursed the land in darkness (the Shadow-Curse) and is sustained by a mysterious immortal entity called the Nightsong ￼. The party ventures into the Gauntlet of Shar beneath Reithwin to either free or destroy the Nightsong (revealed to be the Selûnite aasimar Dame Aylin) ￼. This decision breaks Ketheric’s source of invulnerability.
	5.	Confrontation at Moonrise: Armed with Selûne’s light or Shar’s favor, the party assaults Moonrise Towers and battles Ketheric Thorm. They defeat him (and his undead hordes) once the Nightsong’s fate is resolved ￼, causing Ketheric’s patron Myrkul to withdraw support. Orin the Red (Chosen of Bhaal) and Enver Gortash (Chosen of Bane) escape with Ketheric’s Netherstone, taking the Absolute (an Elder Brain) toward Baldur’s Gate ￼. The party claims Ketheric’s Netherstone as the first of three needed to control or destroy the brain.
	6.	Act III - Baldur’s Gate: The party arrives at the city of Baldur’s Gate while Orin and Gortash vie for power ￼. Lord Gortash declares himself Archduke, controlling the city with his mechanical Steel Watch and political clout, and initially proposes an alliance. Meanwhile, Orin starts a spree of serial killings and kidnaps a party member to blackmail the protagonist. The party navigates city factions (e.g. Flaming Fist, patriars, criminals) and must decide the order to tackle the two remaining Chosen. During this time, companions also seek personal resolutions (e.g. Astarion confronting Cazador, Gale dealing with his orb, etc.).
	7.	Eliminating the Chosen: The party hunts down Orin in the Temple of Bhaal beneath the city, confronting her shapeshifting, murderous cult. Orin is a changeling Bhaalspawn who revels in slaughter ￼; upon her defeat, the party secures Bhaal’s Netherstone. They also confront Gortash in his fortress (Wyrm’s Rock or the Upper City palace), who commands mechanical guards and cult minions. Gortash, the Chosen of Bane, is a cunning tyrant seeking to rule the city through fear and manipulation ￼. Once Gortash falls (or if defeated first), the final Netherstone is obtained. With all three Netherstones, the party can challenge the Elder Brain.
	8.	The Astral Prism & Emperor: Throughout Act III, the truth of the Dream Visitor emerges: it is an illithid called the Emperor, secretly Balduran, the city’s legendary founder transformed into a mind flayer ￼. The Emperor resides in the Astral Prism (the artifact Shadowheart carried) which also imprisons the githyanki prince Orpheus. Orpheus’ psionic power inside the Prism has given the party their resistance to the tadpoles ￼. At a critical moment, the Emperor offers a deal: keep Orpheus imprisoned so the Emperor can help use the Netherstones, or free Orpheus but risk losing the Emperor’s allegiance ￼. The party must choose, affecting who will aid them in the final battle (and who may need to become a mind flayer).
	9.	Final Battle - The Absolute: In the Morphic Pool beneath the city, the party faces the Elder Brain enthralled by the Netherstones and crown. Using the Netherstones and Crown of Karsus, an illithid ally (Emperor, Orpheus, or even the player) attempts Karsus’ Compulsion to control the Brain ￼ ￼. The Elder Brain (self-aware as “The Absolute”) resists and unleashes mental domination and destruction across the city. In an epic confrontation, the party fights the brain and its last defenders. Ultimately, the Brain is subdued and the Netherbrain is at the party’s mercy ￼.
	10.	Resolution: The party decides the fate of the Elder Brain and the thousands of tadpoles linked to it. They can destroy the Brain, liberating the Sword Coast from the Absolute’s control (and curing all infected, including themselves) ￼. This choice frees Baldur’s Gate and ends the cult’s threat. Alternatively, the protagonist (or a power-hungry companion) can betray the allies and seize control of the Brain, emerging as a new tyrannical Absolute in a cruel twist ￼. The ending also varies based on companion epilogues (e.g. Astarion’s struggle with sunlight, Karlach’s fate with her engine, Lae’zel’s choice regarding Vlaakith, etc.), but the Absolute Crisis comes to an end, one way or another.
