Factions and Alignments

Numerous factions operate in BG3’s world, each with agendas and influence. These could be integrated into a reputation or faction system in the MUD. Key factions include:
• The Cult of the Absolute: A cult devoted to the “Absolute,” unknowingly serving an Elder Brain manipulated by the Dead Three. It unites goblins, drow, gnolls, cultists, and anyone implanted with the tadpoles under one banner. (Leaders: Ketheric Thorm, Orin, Gortash.) Their symbol is a purple eye and brain, and their goal is domination through an illithid-controlled army ￼.
• The Dead Three (Bane, Bhaal, Myrkul): Three evil gods who orchestrated the Absolute plot. While not a “faction” one can meet on the street, their Chosen (the antagonists) and their cult followings (Bhaal’s murder cult, Bane’s tyrants, Myrkul’s undead cult) act semi-independently at times ￼. Each has distinct methods: Bhaal’s cult focuses on stealth and killings, Bane’s on order and fear, Myrkul’s on spreading death.
• Emerald Grove Enclave: The druids of the Emerald Grove, led by Halsin (later by Kagha during Act 1). They seek to protect nature and were dealing with refugee influx and shadow curse. Some within (Kagha) leaned towards the Shadow Druids’ extremist views. The Tiefling Refugees allied with them are not an official faction but a group of families fleeing the hellrider’s war in Elturel, trying to survive and eventually head to Baldur’s Gate. Helping or harming one affects your standing with both.
• Harpers: A secret society of spies and do-gooders working to keep evil in check. Represented by Jaheira and her allies at Last Light. The Harpers in BG3 aid against Ketheric and work to safeguard the region. Their symbol is a silver harp. They value discretion, equality, and covert intervention.
• Flaming Fist: The official military/police force of Baldur’s Gate, essentially mercenaries on the city payroll. At game start, their leader, Grand Duke Ravengard, is missing (having been in Avernus during Descent into Avernus). Lower-ranking Fist like Marshall Arabella (hypothetical name) appear at Last Light trying to hold order. In Act 3, the Flaming Fist under Gortash’s influence act as enforcers of his regime until you sway or fight them. They represent law (for good or ill).
• Baldurian Patriots (Upper City patriars): Not directly a joinable faction in-game, but the noble families (“Patriars”) and figures like the Parliament of Peers influence Baldur’s Gate politics. Gortash woos them in his Archduke bid. The player’s actions can earn favor or enmity from nobles depending on how much chaos ensues.
• Githyanki: The githyanki warriors under Vlaakith who appear throughout. They are hostile to anyone with the artifact or tadpoles, as per Vlaakith’s orders. A notable sub-faction is Prince Orpheus’ rebels (like the gith patrol leader Voss who hopes Orpheus will be freed). In a MUD, one could track reputation with githyanki – though most encounters are violent by default.
• Zhentarim: A network of smugglers and mercenaries. In Act 1 the player can meet a Zhent hideout. They’re an independent criminal faction primarily interested in profit and maybe playing both sides. Could be involved in side quests (smuggling Karlach out, or selling rare items).
• Paladins of the Dark Justiciars (Shar): Not a formal faction but Shar’s followers (e.g., Mother Superior Viconia in Act 3) and the Dark Justiciar order (like those in the Gauntlet of Shar). Shadowheart’s affiliation with Shar puts her at odds with Selûnite factions. Shar worshipers often work covertly (like influencing Kagha via a shadow druid).
• Selûnite Clergy: Conversely, Selûne’s followers (e.g., Isobel, Dame Aylin the Nightsong) form another axis. They strive to counter Shar’s darkness (Isobel’s presence keeps Last Light safe, Aylin’s existence keeps Ketheric in check). Helping or harming them has consequences (e.g., killing Isobel triggers Last Light’s fall to darkness).

(In a MUD context, faction reputation could adjust NPC reactions or quest availability. The above groups provide a backdrop for world events and alignments.)

Special Abilities & Spells

BG3 characters come with D&D 5e abilities. In a MUD implementation, these could translate to class abilities or unique skills. Some notable abilities/powers relevant to BG3’s story:
• Illithid Powers (Tadpole-Granted): The parasite in the player’s brain unlocks a suite of psionic abilities as they accept more influence. Examples: Telepathic Communication (speak mind-to-mind), Psionic Domination (charm or dominate a weak mind for a short time), Mind Blast (A cone of psychic damage and stunning), Displacer Beast’s illusory double (one power lets you create an illusion to distract enemies), etc. These powers grow stronger if the player consumes additional tadpoles, but come at a cost (perhaps flagging them as more tainted). In the MUD, these could be represented as a separate skill tree unlocked through quest progression (with warnings that using them might alter alignment or faction standing).
• Slayer Form (Bhaalspawn Transformation): If the player or an NPC (like Orin or Dark Urge) embraces Bhaal’s influence, they can transform into the Slayer – a monstrous, hulking beast of claws and rage. This could be an ability triggered under certain conditions, boosting combat at the cost of control or reputation.
• Divine Intervention (Cleric Ultimate): In BG3, high-level clerics get an ability to call on their deity for a miracle. For instance, Shadowheart (if faithful to Shar) might once per long rest invoke Shar’s darkness to shroud an area (mechanically, a powerful shadow spell), or if she converts to Selûne, call a healing moonlight blessing. In a MUD, this could be a once-a-day skill with dramatic effects, tailored to deity.
• Wild Shape (Druid Polymorph): Druids like Halsin can shapeshift into animal forms (bear, spider, etc.) as abilities. Already common in fantasy MUDs (a “werebear” form etc.), but notable that Halsin’s bear form is story-significant (he hulks out in certain fights).
• Infernal Engine Surge: Karlach’s mechanical heart might grant her bursts of power. For example, once per fight she could activate Infernal Fury – dealing bonus fire damage on attacks and becoming resistant to damage for a short time, but afterwards her engine overheats (maybe dealing minor fire damage to herself or requiring a “cool down” period, pun intended). Using a Soul Coin could be an ability Karlach has in camp or combat to fully cool and empower her (a unique mechanic to her).
• Vampiric Bite (Astarion): As a vampire spawn, Astarion can bite a living target to drink blood. In-game this heals him and can charm the victim. In MUD terms, this could be a combat ability: Bite – steal health and perhaps charm a non-hostile NPC or weaken an enemy.
• Wizard’s Destructive Orb (Gale’s Orb): If Gale’s condition worsens (e.g., he dies or a certain quest triggers), the orb in Gale’s chest can detonate like a magical nuke. While not exactly an “ability” one wants to use, the option for Gale to intentionally sacrifice himself by turning into a magic bomb is an ending in BG3. In a MUD, that might translate to a fail-safe command (or an NPC event) that deals massive area damage at the cost of Gale’s life.
• Action Surge / Superiority (Wyll/Lae’zel): As a Fighter ability, Lae’zel has Action Surge (take an extra action occasionally). Could be just a cooldown skill “Second Wind/Action Surge” healing or giving an extra attack. Wyll, as a Warlock with fiend pact, might have Misty Step (teleport) or the ability to sprout demonic wings (if he remains fiend-pact in Act 3, he gets a form with flight). This could be a temporary flight or dodge ability in MUD.
• Raphael’s Deal (Raphael’s favor): Though not a player ability, an event ability: Raphael, the cambion devil, offers deals. One notable ability is the Orphic Hammer can only be obtained by either stealing it or dealing the Crown of Karsus to Raphael. If a player did strike a bargain, perhaps Raphael grants a one-time Devil’s Boon ability – e.g., summon Raphael’s strength in a fight (but the cost is giving up an item or a soul coin etc.).
• Psionic Resistance (Orpheus’s Blessing): When Orpheus is freed, he can grant a blessing that protects allies from the Elder Brain’s control fully (in game, that’s why party can fight final boss). In MUD, once Orpheus is free, players might receive a permanent buff (flag) “Mind Shield – immune to mind control.”
• Necromancy of Thay (Tome): A special item in BG3 is a forbidden tome that if the player/companion reads fully (with Astarion or Gale’s help), they gain a unique ability Speak with Dead (without a token) or summon undead. This is a deep side content, might not include here, but could be an ability gained via reading that book.

These abilities, if implemented, enrich gameplay:
• Some are unlocked via story (Illithid powers via tadpole use, Orpheus’s blessing via freeing him).
• Some are class-based (Wild Shape, Action Surge).
• Some are item-based (using the Orphic Hammer in combat might trigger Unshackling Strike, Soul Coins usage by Karlach).
• Some are one-off story decisions (Gale’s orb detonation, Raphael’s deal).

Each could be encoded as a skill or a scripted effect. For example, Illithid Mind Blast might be a mage-type AoE stun skill accessible only if the player has embraced the tadpole (flag “IllithidPower” true). The MUD builder could create a class “IllithidTouched” or simply give the player character hidden abilities when appropriate.
