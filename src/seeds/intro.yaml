      Organic matter and machinery merge on the Nautiloid's bridge. The walls pulse as if alive, lit by an eerie cerulean glow. A control console of chitinous design stands here, oozing brine. Through a cracked viewport, the fiery skies of Avernus are visible outside. The air smells of brimstone and blood.

    description: |
      A flesh-lined pod chamber used for teleportation (translocation) of thralls. Twitching tendrils line the walls, and several pod-like cages hang open, one still containing a withered cultist. The floor is slick with viscous fluid. Faint screams echo from within the ship’s depths, underscoring the Nautiloid’s otherworldly horror.
